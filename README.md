# What is this for 

As a team, we are acquiring knowledge and sharing this knowledge, each week with our coworkers. In order to let everyone to know what we are doing, each people that want to share something with the team or with the company has the ability to write an article that will be posted on the CondorLabs Medium account.

So this repo is in order to keep track of the articles written, index and review them. 

## Rules 
*	Every time you write an article you should upload it, and index it to this file. 
*	Each article should be created on his own branch.
* 	The branch name will be the article title
* 	Before publish an article to the master branch a reviewer should approve the article
*  Articles should be placed inside the articles folder
